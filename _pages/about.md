This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by the [Prof. Shirley Ho](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/shirleysho/). 

My research interests lie in health communication and science communication. I am particularly interested in how information and communication technologies, such as online communities and AI chatbots, can improve people's well-being. I am now working on my thesis about how informal caregivers use supportive technologies to seek social support and cope with stress, and the impact of such technologies on caregiver well-being. I use mixed methods research to examine the communication process during people's interaction with supportive technologies, with a particular focus on self-disclosure and social support. 

Before pursuing the PhD degree, I received my MA degree in Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University and a Bachelor's degree in Advertising at Zhejiang University.
