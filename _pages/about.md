About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by the [Prof. Shirley Ho](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/shirleysho/). 

My research interests lie in health communication and science communication. I am particularly interested in how information and communication technologies, such as online communities and AI chatbots, can improve people's well-being. I am now working on my thesis about how informal caregivers use supportive technologies to seek social support and cope with stress, and the impact of such technologies on caregiver well-being. I use mixed methods research to examine the communication process during people's interaction with supportive technologies, with a particular focus on self-disclosure and social support. 

Before pursuing the PhD degree, I received my MA degree in Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University and a Bachelor's degree in Advertising at Zhejiang University.
